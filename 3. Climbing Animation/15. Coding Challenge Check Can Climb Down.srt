Welcome! After some hard work, now our climbing to top is finally working.
欢迎！欢迎 经过一些艰苦的工作，现在我们的攀登到顶部终于可以工作了。

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And with the ability to climb up to the ledge now, our climbing system is really coming together.
随着现在能够爬到壁架上，我们的攀登系统真正地形成了。

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And the next thing that I want to add in is,
而接下来我想加进去的是、

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
see now we are already at the top of a mesh, and by pressing the same climb action key,
现在我们已经在网状结构的顶部了，通过按同样的爬升动作键、

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
wouldn't it be nice if we can climb down the ledge?
如果我们能爬下壁架，那不是很好吗？

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
If we can do that, it can make our climbing system so much better.
如果我们能做到这一点，就能使我们的攀登系统变得更好。

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And to achieve what we want, same as every other feature that we've created so far,
为了达到我们的目的，就像我们到目前为止所创建的其他功能一样、

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
we'll first need to do some kind of check and climb down.
我们首先需要做一些检查并爬下来。

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And with everything that we've done so far, I think this will be a perfect challenge for you to implement by yourself.
鉴于我们到目前为止所做的一切，我认为这将是一个完美的挑战，让你自己来实现。

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So what we want here is simple, when this climb action key is pressed, we want to climb down the ledge if we can.
所以我们在这里想要的很简单，当这个爬升动作键被按下时，如果可以的话，我们想爬下壁架。

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So checking the condition will be our first step, and I'm going to give you a few examples.
所以检查条件将是我们的第一步，我将给你几个例子。

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
You can decide how you want to implement the check.
你可以决定你想如何实现检查。

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
In the scenario one, by pressing the climb action key, we should be able to climb down.
在场景一中，通过按爬升动作键，我们应该能够爬下来。

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
But in the scenario two and three, we shouldn't be able to do so.
但是在情景二和情景三中，我们不应该能够这样做。

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So the key here is to rule out these two situations.
所以这里的关键是要排除这两种情况。

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Feel free to use any methods that you see fit.
请随意使用你认为合适的任何方法。

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And same as always, if the condition is true, I'd like you to print a message to the screen to say "can climb down".
和以往一样，如果条件为真，我希望你在屏幕上打印一条信息，说 "可以爬下来"。

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Alright, put the video now and give this a go and I'll see you in the solution video.
好了，现在把视频放上去，给它一个机会，我们在解决视频中见。

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:38.000
